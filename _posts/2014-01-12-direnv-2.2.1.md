layout: default

Release 2.2.0 has been yanked because it was highly unstable. Below is the
release notes for 2.2.0, 2.2.1 just renamed DIRENV_BACKUP to DIRENV_DIFF and
fixes the regresssion.

----


A lot of small changes that should just make the day to day usage nicer. As
usual if you see something you don't like just
[let me know](https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv/issues/new) !
